                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>CKI began in 1936 as Kiwanis club service project to provide an opportunity for ambitious young men to acquire a college 
                education by assisting them, with financial problems by means of scholarship or part-time employment. Today, CKI boasts a membership 
                of over 13,000 collegians on more than 500 campuses worldwide. Embodied by its tenets of leadership, fellowship, and service at club, 
                district, and international levels, CKI continues to grow as the largest collegiate service organization!</p>
